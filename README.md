# multivariate_GaussianProcessRegression
Implementation of multivariate Gaussian Process regression of the S&P 500 equity index (actually, the code has the flexibility to regress any user-specified timeseries that is sourced from the Federal Reserve Bankâ€™s FRED website). Simply download the driver file  mvGP_driver.py and the implementation file multivariateGaussianProcessRegression.py into the same directory. I developed the code using the Spyder  IDE. Within Spyder I can just execute mvGP_driver to create the plots in the document multivariateGPR.pdf.
